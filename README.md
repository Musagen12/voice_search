# Voice-Controlled Chatbot

This project is a voice-controlled chatbot that enables users to search for items and receive real-time price updates. Designed for accessibility and convenience, the chatbot allows hands-free interaction through voice commands.

## Features

- **Voice Recognition**: Accepts voice commands to initiate searches and queries.
- **Item Search**: Search for products by name or category.
- **Real-time Data Updates**: Uses WebSockets to ensure up-to-date responses on item pricing and availability.

## Tech Stack

- **Backend**: FastAPI for handling API requests.
- **Voice Recognition**: Azure Speech SDK for converting voice commands to text.
- **Frontend**: Basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for a lightweight, responsive interface.
- **LLM Processing**: Mistral LLM hosted locally in Ollama for chatbot responses.

## Usage

1. Access the web interface by opening `index.html`.
2. Click on the microphone button and speak your command, such as:
    - "Search for iPhone 13 prices"
3. The chatbot will respond with current price data and provide updates on selected items as needed.
